# DeBugging

This website is intended for you to practice debugging skills.  There are several errors across this flask site for you to find, and debug.  

# Setup & Installation

As we did before with our flask website, we will need to create a virtual environment, activate that environment, and install flask before running the website. See the steps below:  

Open the site in a new Visual Studio window
Open the terminal and type the following to set up a virtual environment: 
>`python3 -m venv .venv`
You should now have a .venv folder in your project. 

In your terminal prompt lets activate the virtual environment: 
>`. .venv/bin/activate`

and now finally, lets install flask, so we can run our site: 
>`pip install flask`

# Debugging Exercise: 

There are the following errors in the site: 
1. Home page card formatting wonky (x 2)
2. About page not showing
3. Services page Roach image doesn’t appear 
4. Testimonials page has a mis-formatted testimonial 
5. Contact page not showing 

Fix the errors, and push your code to our github classroom.
