        <h2>About DeBugger</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2015, DeBugger has been solving pest problems with the precision and dedication of a software engineer debugging code. Our founder, a former programmer turned exterminator, realized that both bugs in code and bugs in homes require systematic problem-solving, attention to detail, and a commitment to finding the root cause.</p>

            <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; line-height: 1.8;">
                DeBugger was born from a simple observation: pest control and software debugging share more in common than you might think. Both require systematic thinking, identifying root causes, and implementing effective solutions. Our founder, after years of debugging code, decided to apply the same problem-solving mindset to a different kind of bug—the kind that crawls, flies, and invades your home.
                <br><br>
                What started as a small local business has grown into a trusted name in extermination services. We've helped thousands of homeowners and businesses eliminate their pest problems, always with the same attention to detail and commitment to excellence that defines great software engineering.
                <br><br>
                Today, DeBugger continues to innovate in pest control, using the latest technology and methods to keep your spaces bug-free. We're not just exterminators—we're problem solvers who happen to specialize in bugs.
